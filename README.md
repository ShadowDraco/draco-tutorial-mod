# Fabric Example Mod

I added 2 Items, and one Block with its associated item so far

*sapphire's give you experience levels when used*
*ruby's when used place blocks underneath and in front of the player while jumping and falling **toggleable***
*added ruby blocks which do a lot of crazy and harmful things*


- todo
  - Add blockstate to my ruby block so that it can be used when "double jumping" with a "charged" ruby
