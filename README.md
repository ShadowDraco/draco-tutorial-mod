# Fabric Example Mod

I added 2 Items, and one Block with its associated item so far

- _sapphire's give you experience levels when used_

- _ruby's when used (toggled) place blocks underneath and in front of the player while jumping and falling_

- _added ruby blocks which do a lot of crazy and harmful things when destroyed but pay off when broken_

- create ruby blocks when "double jumping" with a "charged" ruby - all blocks disappear when ruby becomes uncharged

- todo
  - add tools and armor
  - add world generation for ruby block
  - add sapphire to loot chests
